Basics about Elevator

1. Non-homogeneous stochastic arrival of customers
2. Two types of calls: internal and external
3. Has a speed and direction at any point in time
4. Doors open and close
5. Stationary on a floor until doors close
6. Customers can abandon call.

Points of Interets 

1. Expected wait time of users in the system
2. Maximum wait time
3. Expected number of people whose wait time is
4. substantially greater than the expected wait time
(Quality of Service)
5. Expected length of queue
6. Energy used (Cost)
7. inhabitants want to reach their destination comfortable

Model Formulation 
Arrivals
    1.State and time-dependent arrival rates
        1.1 Exogenous arrival rates on ground floor
        1.2 Arrival rates on floors 2-8 are time dependent and floor occupancy dependent
Elevator System
    1.8 floors and 3 elevators
    2.Doors remain open for 3 sec after last passenger enters
    3.Elevators take 5 sec to traverse floor
    4.Elevator has a capacity of 8 passenger

Model Assumptions 

Arrivals
    1.Passengers arrive according to non-homogeneous, time-varying Poisson process
    2.Passengers are very patient and do not abandon.
         In fact, when passengers are blocked, they simply push the button again after the elevator departs.
Elevator System
    1.Passenger requests to go up or down
    2.Western elevator system
         Passenger assignments may not be changed
    3.Destination floor distribution is time dependent
         Beginning of day vs. lunch time & end of day

vmax dominates traveling time
The model for the large height traveling time can be
simplified into:
ttravel = Stravel/vmax + (ta + tj)
